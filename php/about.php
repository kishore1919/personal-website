                    <h1>Bonjour! Je vous remercie de votre visite!</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am Gervin Fung Da Xuen.<br><br>
                        I am an undergraduate studying Software Engineering.
                        Java is my primary language in programming and currently I am trying to learn web development and python.<br><br>
                        My 1<sup>st</sup> Program, a.k.a. The "Hello World" Program was written in C language during my foundation in UTAR. <br>
                        However I am not interested in programming, it wasn't until I decided to redo the assignments myself
                        , that I discover programming can also be very fun, the sheer joy of making things in your own design is simply fantastic.<br>
                        Although I do admit that programming can be difficult and boring at times, but that doesn't stop me from continuing. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of the projects in Portfolio Page are what I have programmed during my free time, while some of them are my assignments.
